# Endpoints

## Public

Public endpoints do not require authorization and are safe to use in a browser.

- Delivery options
    - [GetDeliveryOptions]
- Pickup locations
    - [GetPickupLocations]
- Carriers
    - [GetCarriers]
    - [GetCarrier]

## Private

Private endpoints require an Authorization header. This should be a base64
encoded MyParcel API key. You can create one in the shop settings in
our [backoffice]. See [Authorization] in the API documentation for more
information.

- Shipments
    - [GetShipment]
    - [GetShipments]
